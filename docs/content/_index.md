# Large Language Model Intermediate Representation Overview

The LLMIR project is a novel approach to building reusable and extensible
compiler infrastructure for large language model inference. LLMIR aims to unify and optimize 
LLM inference workflows, improve compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce 
inference latency, and enhance integration between various LLM frameworks.

LLMIR is a dedicated compilation middle layer for platform architects and developers, built on 
the MLIR framework. It leverages MLIR's flexible infrastructure to represent and transform 
computational graphs. LLMIR can integrate with multiple LLM inference frameworks (like vLLM, SGLang) 
by converting their high-level operators or model graphs into a unified intermediate representation 
for further optimization.

## Project Status

LLMIR is currently in active development. The project is following the development plan as outlined in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chenxingqiang/llmir.git). We are in the early phases of building the core infrastructure and MLIR dialect definition.

## Project Resources

For more information on LLMIR, please see:

* [Project Repository](https://github.com/chenxingqiang/llmir.git)
* [Developer Guide](/getting_started/DeveloperGuide/) for getting started with LLMIR.

## What is LLMIR for?

LLMIR is an intermediate representation specialized for optimizing large language model inference. It provides:

* The ability to represent inference workflows from popular LLM frameworks (such as vLLM, SGLang), including
  dynamic shapes, batching strategies, and framework-specific operators.
* Optimizations and transformations specifically designed for LLM inference (e.g. attention fusion, KV cache management).
* Cross-framework end-to-end compilation for LLM inference, enabling optimizations like attention computation fusion,
  KV cache management, quantization, and pipeline parallelism.
* Ability to target various hardware platforms (GPU, TPU, ASIC, CPU) efficiently by leveraging the MLIR ecosystem.
* Representation of hardware-specific operations for accelerators specialized in LLM workloads.

## Core Value Proposition

Compared to using the native execution paths of individual frameworks, LLMIR's core value lies in providing cross-framework
compilation capabilities for end-to-end optimization. This includes:

* **Performance Improvement**: Leveraging compilation optimizations to reduce inference latency and increase throughput
* **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizing memory usage, supporting longer sequences and larger batch sizes
* **Scalability**: Supporting different hardware platforms and inference frameworks
* **Usability**: Providing developer-friendly APIs to lower integration barriers

## Key Features (Under Development)

* **PagedKVCache**: Efficient key-value cache implementation for optimized attention computation
* **MLIR Dialect for LLMs**: Custom operations and types for language model inference
* **Memory Optimizations**: Block-based memory management for efficient, low-fragmentation memory usage
* **Multi-sequence Support**: Handle multiple concurrent sequences with varying lengths
* **Hardware Targeting**: Backend code generation for various platforms
