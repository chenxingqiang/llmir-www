# LLMIR Documentation

Welcome to the LLMIR technical documentation. This section provides detailed information about the architecture, components, and features of the LLMIR compiler infrastructure.

## Architecture Overview

LLMIR (Large Language Model Intermediate Representation) is a compiler infrastructure for large language models based on MLIR, designed to optimize and accelerate LLM inference through specialized compilation techniques.

## Key Features

LLMIR includes several key features designed to optimize LLM inference:

### KV Cache Optimization

Efficient management of key-value caches for transformer-based LLMs, including block-based allocation, optimized memory access patterns, and specialized attention operations.

### Quantization Support

Comprehensive quantization capabilities for reducing model size and improving inference performance, including various quantization strategies and hardware-specific optimizations.

### Distributed Deployment

Support for executing large models across multiple devices and nodes through tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and efficient memory management.

## Development Status

LLMIR is currently in active development, following a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1 (Current Focus)**: Building the core infrastructure, including MLIR dialect design and implementation
2. **Phase 2 (Planned)**: Implementing core optimizations like KV cache management and attention fusion
3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Adding advanced features such as quantization, parallelism strategies, and advanced hardware targeting
