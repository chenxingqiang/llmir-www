# LLMIR Architecture

This section provides detailed information about the LLMIR architecture, its key components, and features.

## Key Features

LLMIR is being developed with several key optimizations for LLM inference:

* [KV Cache Optimization](KVCache): Efficient key-value cache management techniques
* [Quantization Support](Quantization): Comprehensive quantization capabilities 
* [Distributed Deployment](DistributedDeployment): Support for multi-device inference
* [Performance Evaluation](PerformanceEvaluation): Benchmarking and evaluation methodologies

## System Architecture

LLMIR (Large Language Model Intermediate Representation) is a compiler infrastructure for large language models based on MLIR, designed to optimize and accelerate LLM inference through specialized compilation techniques.

LLMIR follows a layered architecture:

### Front-end Converters

The front-end converters are responsible for translating models and operations from existing frameworks into the LLMIR representation:

- **vLLM Converter**: Translates vLLM's model representation and PagedAttention mechanism into LLMIR
- **SGLang Converter**: Maps SGLang's computation graphs to LLMIR operations

### MLIR Optimization Pipeline

The optimization pipeline includes a range of passes specifically designed for LLM inference:

- **General Optimizations**: Common compiler optimizations like constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop optimizations
- **LLM-Specific Optimizations**: KV cache blocking, attention computation fusion, quantization transformations
- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Optimizations targeting specific hardware features

### Backend Generators

Backend generators produce optimized code for different execution targets:

- **CUDA/HIP Code Generation**: For NVIDIA and AMD GPUs
- **LLVM IR Generation**: For CPUs and general platforms
- **Specialized Accelerator Code**: For ML accelerators like TPUs

### Runtime Library

LLMIR includes a runtime library that provides key functionality:

- **Memory Management**: Efficient KV cache allocation and scheduling
- **Execution Scheduler**: Dynamic batching and request management
- **Device Communication**: Multi-device data exchange for distributed inference

## LLMIR Dialect

The core of LLMIR is a specialized MLIR dialect for LLM operations, including custom types and operations tailored for LLM workloads. For detailed information about specific features, please visit the dedicated pages listed above.

## Development Status

LLMIR is being developed in phases according to our development plan:

1. **Phase 1 (Current Focus)**: Building the core infrastructure, including MLIR dialect design and implementation
2. **Phase 2 (Planned)**: Implementing core optimizations like KV cache management and attention fusion
3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Adding advanced features such as quantization, parallelism strategies, and advanced hardware targeting
