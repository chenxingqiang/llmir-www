# LLMIR Project Governance

LLMIR (Large Language Model Intermediate Representation) is an independent project that builds upon the MLIR framework, which is part of the LLVM project. While LLMIR leverages MLIR's infrastructure, it is currently maintained as a separate project.

## Current Project Status

LLMIR is in the early stages of development and follows the MIT license, which is more permissive than LLVM's license. The project is currently being developed by Chen Xingqiang from TuringAI in Hangzhou, China.

## Development Process

LLMIR follows a structured development process:

1. **Design Phase**: Requirements clarification, detailed design generation, and human approval before proceeding
2. **Development Phase**: Code implementation based strictly on approved designs
3. **Testing Phase**: Verification of implementation against the design
4. **Verification Phase**: Iteration and refinement based on test results

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to LLMIR are welcome from all individuals and organizations. The project follows these guidelines:

1. All code contributions should be submitted through pull requests
2. Design documents should be provided for significant new features
3. Test coverage is required for all new functionality
4. Code reviews are mandatory for all contributions

## Future Governance Plans

As the project matures, we intend to establish:

1. A formal technical steering committee
2. Clear contribution and review processes
3. Transparent decision-making procedures
4. Regular community meetings and planning
