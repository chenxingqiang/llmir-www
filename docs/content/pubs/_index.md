# LLMIR Publications

## Planned Publications

As LLMIR is a new project in active development, formal publications are currently in preparation. The following represents our publication roadmap as the project matures:

### Core LLMIR Architecture

* **LLMIR: A Specialized Intermediate Representation for Large Language Model Inference** - 
  A comprehensive overview of the LLMIR architecture, design principles, and implementation strategy.
  
* **Optimizing KV Cache Management Through LLMIR** - 
  A detailed exploration of how LLMIR represents and optimizes key-value caches for transformer models.

* **LLMIR for Quantization: Compiler Support for Efficient LLM Inference** - 
  An exploration of LLMIR's approach to quantization for reduced memory footprint and improved performance.

### LLMIR Applications

* **Distributed LLM Inference with LLMIR Pipeline Parallelism** - 
  How LLMIR enables efficient distribution of LLM computation across multiple devices.

* **Hardware-Specific Optimizations for LLM Inference: The LLMIR Approach** - 
  An exploration of LLMIR's strategies for targeting different hardware backends.

## Technical Documents

In the meantime, we maintain detailed technical documentation:

* [Development Plan](https://github.com/chenxingqiang/llmir.git) - 
  The comprehensive development roadmap for LLMIR, including architectural details and implementation strategies.

* [LLMIR Architecture Overview](/getting_started/DeveloperGuide/) - 
  Technical overview of the LLMIR system architecture and key components.

## Early Adopters & Case Studies

As LLMIR matures, we plan to document case studies on:

* Integration with vLLM for high-performance inference
* SGLang and LLMIR for structured generation
* LLMIR optimization techniques for various hardware targets
